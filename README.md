# Source Codes from APUE 3rd ed.

This project contains the codes from Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment 3rd ed. The textbook has been used in the "System Software Security" class from Ajou University. The codes inside extensively depends on *apue.h* and normal compile process wouldn't suffice, so I analyzed the header and wrote makefiles.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

I only tested the source codes on macOS, since my laptop was running on it. See [this link](http://www.apuebook.com/code3e.html) for building on other platforms.

clang was used for compilation, but gcc would do.

### Compiling

```bash
make
```
